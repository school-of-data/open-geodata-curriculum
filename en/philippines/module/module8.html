You have no knowledge of where the airport is situated with respect to the city, nor where the hotel is, so the first thing you do is open a map to help you navigate through this new and excited city! You take your phone out, open a map app and you select the start point - the airport - and the end point - your hotel - then ask for the route, by foot, car or public transport. In a matter of seconds, the routing app offers you the best solution for you to get from point A to point B and it highlights it by drawing a distinct line following streets and alleys, as visible in figure 8.1.</p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig81.png" alt="Getting from point A to B using Openstreetmap" title="Getting from point A to B using Openstreetmap"/></p><p>Figure 8.1 - Getting from point A to B using Openstreetmap</p><h2 id="breakdown-of-the-concepts"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#breakdown-of-the-concepts"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Breakdown of the concepts</h2><p>This is a classic example of vector data use and it breaks down into several concepts that we will define below. </p><p>The data used is spatial - it has a very well defined location on Earth, its attributes are also well identified. Thus, a point with longitude and latitude and the attribute name= Clark International Airport - represents the starting point A and a point with another pair of longitude and latitude and the attribute name= Hotel Boss represents the end point B. Streets are represented by lines composed of segments and vertices (represented by blue small circles in figure 8.2), with attributes such as name, direction, speed limitation etc. </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig82.png" alt="Vector lines representing streets and the associated attribute table" title="Vector lines representing streets and the associated attribute table"/></p><p>Figure 8.2 - Vector lines representing streets and the associated attribute table</p><p>Streets represent a network model that is basically a collection of topologically interconnected point and line features. The results of the algorithm that calculates the route from point A to point B - in our case from the airport to the hotel - are highly dependent on the quality of the vectors, both in geometry - topology rules are respected - and in attributes - if a road is unidirectional that must be indicated so the routing doesn’t lead you the wrong way. 		</p><h3 id="the-vector-data-model"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-vector-data-model"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The vector data model</h3><p>As presented in module 0, there are 2 data models used in a geographical information system - GIS: raster and vector. Geospatial data always includes a <strong>spatial</strong> component indicating the location or the spatial distribution of the phenomenon at hand and an <strong>attribute</strong> component that describes its properties. The choice between using the raster or the vector data model for a particular situation depends on the source of the data as well as its intended use. </p><p>The vector data model is used to represent areas, lines and points (Figure 8.1). </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig83.png" alt="vector data with attribute table" title="vector data with attribute table"/></p><p>Figure 8.1 - vector data with attribute table</p><h3 id="metadata"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#metadata"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Metadata</h3><p>Metadata is most simply defined as data about data. It characterises, at different levels of detail, the dataset that it is associated to, including categories such as: who is the provider/owner of the dataset, what is the license, in what language are the attributes written, what was the coordinate system used, which geographical area it describes and what is the reference year, keywords, what are the known limitations, accuracy level, what was the original scope of the dataset and many more.</p><p>Metadata is paramount because a clear understanding of the data to be used in a specific analysis can make the difference between a correct or a biased decision. If one must identify where to place a new temporary hospital, but the road data is old and no longer reflects the reality on site, then any decision based on it will be inaccurate. </p><p>Because of the importance of metadata, its categories (their definitions, name, what kind of information they can store etc.) follow well-defined and standardized structures. These metadata well-structured files can then be integrated in dedicated catalogues, allowing a user to search and find geographical data only by querying the characteristics she is interested in, without downloading and analysing the data herself. There are numerous metadata catalogues and, when standardised, they can be accessed through different functionalities within GIS software. An example of that will be presented in Module 9 QGIS Plugins. </p><p>It must be said that metadata is not a specificity of geospatial resources, but it applies to any kind of data.</p><h3 id="rational-of-vector-processing"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#rational-of-vector-processing"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Rational of vector processing</h3><p>The power of GIS lies in its unique capacity of connecting geometric properties that define real objects and phenomena in our world and their attributes - either observed, measured or calculated - and allowing through specialised software to perform operations on their geometries, on their attributes or both in order to derive new valuable information. </p><p>Although most oftenly, GIS is closely associated with maps that simply display geographical information, its functionalities go far beyond the creation of cartographic representations, be they dynamic or static. </p><p><strong>Spatial data analysis</strong> (synonyms: spatial analysis, geospatial analysis, geographical analysis, spatial interaction) is a general term referring to any technique designed to identify patterns, to detect anomalies and to test theories based on spatial data. An analysis is spatial if and only if the results are sensible to relocation of the objects analysed - simply put, <strong>location matters</strong>. As information technology evolved, scientists started applying various techniques from the literature of statistics, geometry, topology and other sciences to the analysis of geographic data to study patterns and phenomena on the Earth’s surface. </p><p><strong>Geostatistics</strong> is a branch of statistics that applies to spatial data. The most common employed methods are related to interpolation, which is a mathematical process that allows  estimation of unknown values based on the known ones. </p><p><strong>Topology</strong> is a branch of mathematics that allows the GIS user to control the geometric relationships between features and maintain geometric integrity. Topology is best understood as a set of rules that ensures spatial data quality that can apply to the same vector layer or more. The rules are designed as to respect the real world relationships that the vector layers represent. For example there can be no gaps between the polygons that represent cadastral parcels in a region, or no point belonging to the vector layer that represents individual trees can not be contained in any polygon of the vector layer that represents buildings within a region. </p><p>GIS software offers functionalities allowing the user to define relevant topology rules, as well as algorithms to check if they apply and to clean the vector layer where inconsistencies are identified. </p><p>Geoprocessing is a general term used to define any operation - process - applied to a geographical dataset, with the scope of obtaining a derived dataset opening new insights on the data. Common geoprocessing operations are geographic feature overlay, feature selection and analysis, topology processing and data conversion. Geoprocessing allows one to define, manage, and analyze geographic information to support decision making. </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig84.png" alt="elements of a geoprocessing operation" title="elements of a geoprocessing operation"/></p><p>Figure 8.4 - elements of a geoprocessing operation</p><p><strong>TIP</strong>: You can access Processing Algorithms (such as those used in this module) on the <strong>Processing Toolbox</strong> or <strong>Locator Bar</strong>.</p><h2 id="main-content"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#main-content"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Main content:</h2><h3 id="phase-1-understanding-your-data"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#phase-1-understanding-your-data"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Phase 1: Understanding your data.</h3><p>There are many geoprocessing operations that can be performed on vector data, most commonly including geographic feature overlay, feature selection and analysis, topology processing and data conversion. In this first phase, we will become familiar with some of them, understanding how they work and what results we can expect. </p><h4 id="step-1-prepare-your-working-environment"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#step-1-prepare-your-working-environment"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a><strong>Step 1. Prepare your working environment.</strong></h4><p>Open QGIS, set up the coordinate reference system you will work in - EPSG 3123 -  and add the following data layers:</p><ul><li>Polygons - administrative boundaries; buildings; land use;</li><li>Lines - roads, rivers;</li><li>Points - places of worship, places of interest</li></ul><p>At this point, your QGIS map window should look like in figure 8.5, of course, most probably, in other colours. </p><p><strong>TIP</strong>: Use spatial indices to speed up and improve processing time. You can do this using the <strong>Create spatial index</strong> algorithm.</p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig85.png" alt="Loaded vector data sets: points, line and polygons" title="Loaded vector data sets: points, line and polygons"/></p><p>Figure 8.5 - Loaded vector data sets: points, line and polygons</p><p><strong>Check!</strong> All layers are in the same coordinate system (EPSG 3123) by looking in the right down side corner.

Understand what you are looking at.</strong></h4><p>At this point, we have 7 vector layers loaded into our QGIS project. The next steps will help us understand our data. </p><ul><li><p>Check how many features we have in a layer - there are several ways to do that: </p><ul><li><strong>Double click on the layer of interest ‣ Properties ‣ Information ‣ Feature count</strong></li><li><strong>Open the attribute table of the layer of interest and look at the upper central side</strong> </li></ul></li></ul><p>Before running any basic statistics, let us complete the attribute table with some geometric attributes (see Module 6 for details): </p><ul><li>Roads layer - calculate length for each road segment and store it in the attribute table: output field name - length <code>round($length, 2)</code></li><li>Buildings layer - calculate the area for each building and store it in the attribute table; output field name - area <code>round($area, 2)</code></li></ul><p>Now, the attribute fields are filled, yet if you are not certain in which measurement unit QGIS has calculated the length of roads segments and areas of buildings, then checking the coordinate system information will help you. </p><p>Click on the down right corner of the QGIS map window, on EPSG 3123 and a window as the one in figure 8.6 will appear. </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig86.png" alt="Specifications of the coordinate reference system used in the QGIS project" title="Specifications of the coordinate reference system used in the QGIS project"/></p><p>Figure 8.6 - Specifications of the coordinate reference system used in the QGIS project</p><p>Thus, we find out that the measurement unit is the meter, therefore the lengths are measured in meters and the areas in square meters. </p><ul><li><p>Run basic statistics on the loaded layers to get a better grip on your data (figure 8.7 ):</p><ul><li><strong>Vector menu ‣ Analysis Tools ‣ Basic statistics for fields</strong></li><li><strong>Processing toolbox window ‣ search for &#x27;stats&#x27;</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig87.png" alt="Basics statistics for fields" title="Basics statistics for fields"/></p><p>Figure 8.7 - Basics statistics for fields</p><p>The statistics returned depend on the field type we choose and are generated as an HTML file.</p><p>Let’s run it on our roads layer and see what results we get.

</code></pre><p>From these basic statistics, we find out that there are 64473 road segments in the loaded layer, where the shortest has 0.04m and the longest 19690.45m - almost 20 km. We find out that the sum of roads in Pampanga is almost 14k km (13927.358 km). Given that the mean is greater than the median, it tells us that the 2nd half of the dataset contains longer road segments and that it outweighs the road segments in the 1st half. However, the median shows that most road segments have length around 500 m. </p><p>Running the basic statistics on the layer Buildings for the type category, we obtain the followings: </p><pre><code>Analyzed field: type

That is because the attribute field we ran the algorithm on is different, we don’t have numbers but words - types of buildings. We find out that out of 827657 buildings in Pampanga, for 773210 we don’t know the type of the building.

Basic checks to quickly find errors in your data.</strong></h4><p>Perfect, flawless datasets are the equivalent of the ideal gas in physics. There is no such thing, but many can come very close to it. Therefore, before doing any kind of analysis to extract information, at least some basic checks are necessary on how <em>clean</em> the data we have are. </p><p>There are many types of errors that can affect the quality of your data and, given the scope of your geospatial analysis, their influence on the final result can be more or less important. For example, if you use geospatial data to route yourself from point A to point B by car, then having a roads layer complete with attributes on which streets are one way or  closed to road traffic, is essential to get a viable result.  However, if your routing is by foot, then that information is not crucial for your result. </p><p>When referring to geospatial data errors, there are 2 main terms that need to be well understood: </p><p><strong>Accuracy</strong> is the degree to which information on a map matches real-world values and it applies both to the geometry and to attributes.</p><p><strong>Precision</strong> refers to the level of measurement and exactness of description in a geospatial dataset.</p><p><strong>An error</strong> encompasses both the imprecision of data and its inaccuracies. <strong>Data quality </strong>refers to the level of precision and accuracy of the datasets and it is most often documented in data quality reports. </p><p>Analysing and _cleaning _a geospatial dataset can be a very time consuming and cumbersome task, however - as shown in the example above - it is essential. In this section, we present a few GIS functionalities that allow a user to perform fast checks on vector data and draw a set of preliminary conclusions on its quality. </p><p><strong>Topology checks.</strong></p><p>QGIS offers a core functionality that allows the user to perform a series of topological checks on the loaded vector datasets, named Topology Checker. The Topology Checker is a Core plugin and can be activated from the <strong>Manage and Install Plugins Dialog</strong>. Open the Manage and Install Plugins Dialog and make sure that the Topology Checker plugin is activated (with check sign).

Although there are functionalities to support a semi-automatically cleaning process, the user’s input is often necessary. For example, in figure 8.14, we have zoomed in an error in our points of interest layer, a duplicated point. As it can be seen, there are 2 point depicting one cafe, the difference being in the attribute table where one is listed as a cafe and one as a “doityourself” - which one can assume might be a popular name for cafes where you prepare your own coffee. </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig814.png" alt="Duplicate point error in points of interest vector layer" title="sDuplicate point error in points of interest vector layer"/></p><p>Figure 8.14 - Duplicate point error in points of interest vector layer</p><p>In this particular case, the decision of the user would most probably be to remove the duplicate point, as it can insert error in further spatial analysis. For example, if a town official wants to know how many restaurants and cafes are in a specific neighbourhood, the duplicate point will insert an error in the results and that could eventually lead to mislead decisions.  </p><p>Therefore, we will proceed with an automatic removal of the duplicate points. To do it, we will use a core functionality of QGIS - <strong>Delete duplicate geometries</strong> - found in the processing toolbox.

Following the concepts described at the beginning of this module, geoprocessing represents any process applied to a geographical dataset, with the scope of obtaining a derived dataset opening new insights on the data. And this is what we will attempt to do in the following. </p><p>There are many operations that can be performed on one or more geospatial datasets and during this first step, we will run some of the most common ones to understand how they operate. </p><p><strong>Buffer.</strong> Imagine that you need to analyse a new piece of legislation that asks that on an area of 500 meters around places of worship there can be no other construction built. You would want to see where exactly those delinations are and maybe even how many square meters that is for your district. First step is to define a buffer around the places of worship: <strong>Vector ‣ geoprocessing tools ‣ Buffer</strong>. When the buffer window opens, set the parameters like in figure 8.23: </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig823.png" alt="Setting the parameters for a 500 m buffer around the places of worship" title="Setting the parameters for a 500 m buffer around the places of worship"/></p><p>Figure 8.23 - Setting the parameters for a 500 m buffer around the places of worship</p><p>A detail of the result of the geoprocessing is depicted in figure 8.24: </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig824.png" alt="Running buffer on a point vector layer" title="Running buffer on a point vector layer"/></p><p>Figure 8.24 - Running buffer on a point vector layer</p><p>To completely answer the initial question, the next step is to calculate the areas for all buffers and sum them up (see Phase 1, step 4) - figure 8.25. </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig825.png" alt="Calculate area for the newly obtained layer, then calculate using GroupStats the total sum" title="Running buffer on Calculate area for the newly obtained layer, then calculate using GroupStats the total sum point vector layer"/></p><p>Figure 8.25 - Calculate area for the newly obtained layer, then calculate using GroupStats the total sum.</p><p><strong>Clip.</strong> Imagine you want to know where all the industrial delineated areas are in your district and also how many buildings are within that perimeter. Visual inspecting your vector data, you notice that you have a number of industrial areas that contain several buildings. You want to separate those buildings and to use them further. First step is to select all features in the landuse layer that have as attribute industrial (see module 6 for how to do that). Afterwards, you go to <strong>Vector ‣ Geoprocessing tools ‣ Clip</strong> and choose as the layer to be clipped buildings_cleaned. Your results should look like in figure 8.27b. </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig826_a.png" alt="Figure 8.26a - Select landuse fclass = industrial" title="Figure 8.26a - Select landuse fclass = industrial"/></p><p>Figure 8.26a - Select landuse fclass = industrial. </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig826_b.png" alt="Reduced selection of a few buildings and industrial landuse, so the computation can finish faster" title="Reduced selection of a few buildings and industrial landuse, so the computation can finish faster"/></p><p>Figure 8.26b - Reduced selection of a few buildings and industrial landuse, so the computation can finish faster. </p><p>Run the Clip algorithm.

Geospatial analysis can be of assistance. You can start by calculating the Thiessen polygons. Based on an area containing at least two points, a Thiessen Polygon is a 2-dimensional shape which boundaries contain all space which is closer to a point within the area than any other point without the area. A good use example is in meteorology, where weather stations are discrete points, yet the information collected is considered to be measured out on the surface based on the thiessen polygons. </p><p>To respond to the above question, we will run the algorithm only for points that have the attribute school at type. Thus, make the selection as instructed in module 6. You should have 88 features selected on layer pois_cleaned. Go to <strong>Vector ‣ Geometry Tools ‣ Voronoi Polygons..</strong> After setting the parameters - select the point layer for which we want the Voronoi polygons calculated and a 30% extension so that the entire Pampanga province is contained, you should see a result like in figure 8.28d. </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig828_a.png" alt="Filtering the poi layer to get all schools" title="Filtering the poi layer to get all schools"/></p><p>Figure 8.28a - Filtering the poi layer to get all schools</p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig828_b.png" alt="All schools in the poi layer" title="All schools in the poi layer"/></p><p>Figure 8.28b - All schools in the poi layer</p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig828_c.png" alt="Running the Voronoi polygon algorithm" title="Running the Voronoi polygon algorithm"/></p><p>Figure 8.28c - Running the Voronoi polygon algorithm</p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig828_d.png" alt="Results of applying Thiessen (Voronoi) polygons algorithm to a point vector layer" title="Results of applying Thiessen (Voronoi) polygons algorithm to a point vector layer"/></p><p>Figure 8.28d - Results of applying Thiessen (Voronoi) polygons algorithm to a point vector layer</p><p>Sometimes, the necessities impose the requirement of having information in smaller, clearly defined and equal areas and not for an entire large region, such as a country or a big city. Therefore, the data needs to be analysed and visualised in a sliced, well-defined way, allowing comparison that otherwise could prove difficult without a ground common reference. </p><p>Let us assume that you have to present a report that will allow comparisons done for units of 10X10 km over the administrative unit, including: </p><ol><li>density of green spaces (parks, forests) in report to the built-up space per unit;</li><li>total length of streets for each unit;</li><li>total length of waterways for each unit;</li><li>total number of public buildings for each unit (schools, kindergartens, hospitals , town halls etc.).</li></ol><p>We’ve seen that there are tools that can assist us in calculating the total surface occupied by a certain type of feature, however the first step is to create our 10X10 units - cell grids.

To obtain that we will <strong>intersect</strong> the 2 overlaid polygon vector layers. The algorithm extracts the overlapping portions of features in the Input - the landuse layer and Overlay layer - the grid layer. Go to <strong>Vector - Geoprocessing Tools - Intersection</strong> or look for <strong>Intersection in the Processing Toolbox or Locator Bar</strong> Set the algorithm parameters as in figure 8.31.</p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig831.png" alt="Parameters for the intersect algorithm" title="Parameters for the intersect algorithm"/></p><p>Figure 8.31 - Parameters for the intersect algorithm</p><p>The result should look like in figure 8.32.</p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig832.png" alt="Result of running the intersection algorithm to clip the landuse vector polygons to the grid layer" title="Result of running the intersection algorithm to clip the landuse vector polygons to the grid layer"/></p><p>Figure 8.32 - Result of running the intersection algorithm to clip the landuse vector polygons to the grid layer. </p><p>Now for each 10X10 km unit, we have the landuse features that we can work with.

Thus, for green space, we will select all features that have the attribute value for <code>fclass: </code>meadow, grass, nature_reserve, park, forest. In attribute table, in the expression filed write down: <code> &quot;fclass&quot; =  &#x27;meadow&#x27; or  &quot;fclass&quot; =  &#x27;grass&#x27; or  &quot;fclass&quot; =  &#x27;nature_reserve&#x27; or  &quot;fclass&quot; =  &#x27;park&#x27; or  &quot;fclass&quot;  =  &#x27;forest&#x27;</code>. Similarly, you can just type: <code>&quot;fclass&quot; in (&#x27;meadow&#x27;, &#x27;grass&#x27;, &#x27;nature_reserve&#x27;, &#x27;park&#x27;, &#x27;forest&#x27;)</code>.

However, the 10X10km grid of the Pampanga province has a known number of grid cells, and that is 42. Therefore, we need to summarise the areas for all types of green spaces (forests, parks etc.) an built-up spaces (commercial, residential etc.) and join it accordingly to all of the 42 grid cells. To do this, we will use the <strong>GroupStats</strong> plugin to sum up for each grid_id all the green categories, respectively all the built-up categories.

Interpolation - estimating missing data</h3><p>The last phase of the vector data module introduces the concept of data estimation. We are used to estimating almost daily on various topics, for example how much time it will take to get from home to work in certain conditions. We are used to giving our best guess,  based on previous experience and hunches. However, in estimating missing data the best guess is replaced by very well defined mathematical equations with well known limitations. </p><p>The subject requires significant knowledge in statistics and results should always be regarding through the light of their limitations. </p><p>That being said, we will introduce a short example of data estimation that will make the transition to the next module - raster data processing. </p><p><strong>Interpolation</strong> is a mathematical process through which one can estimate the values that are missing based on a limited number of values that do exist. And those situations are common - imagine meteorological information. Data on surface temperatures and of how much rain has fallen can be measured only in specific points at calibrated meteo stations, and not on the entirety of a surface. However, we don’t have “blind spots&#x27;&#x27; of no temperatures on the maps we see in the meteo section. Thus, the rest of the values - as to construct the seamless phenomena - are obtained by interpolation.
The assumption on which interpolation is based is that spatially distributed objects are spatially correlated; in other words, things that are close together tend to have similar characteristics. </p><p>There are many interpolation methods implemented in GIS software packages, deciding which one is the best in each particular case depends on the specificity of the data, what it represents and the geostatistics understanding of the user doing the interpolation. </p><p>To make a quick check on what interpolation methods are available in QGIS, go to the Processing Toolbox and write in the search bar the keyword interpolation. The result should look like in figure 8.41. </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig841.png" alt="Interpolation methods available in QGIS" title="Interpolation methods available in QGIS"/></p><p>Figure 8.41 - Interpolation methods available in QGIS</p><p>As can be observed, through QGIS the user has access to other algorithms, implemented in GRASS or SAGA, as a result of the integration into QGIS of these (and other) very powerful software solutions. </p><p>Diving into the math behind each interpolation algorithm is beyond the scope of this module. However, for demonstration purposes, we will simulate precipitation data interpolation to obtain a seamless dataset on the quantity of precipitations fallen in our area of interest, Pampanga province. </p><p>As the exercise is purely for showing purposes, we will create our own set of point data - to represent the meteo stations where precipitation values have been registered for the course of one week. </p><p>Thus, the first step is creating a new vector layer - point type - with points randomly assigned inside the extent of the Pampanga province. There are several ways to do that, either with the algorithm of <strong>Random points in polygons..</strong> or with the algorithm <strong>Random points in layer bounds..</strong>. Go to <strong>Vector ‣ Research Tools ‣ Random points in polygons…</strong>. You may also search for the algorithm in the Processing Toolbox or Locator bar. Choose as parameters: </p><ul><li>93 points</li><li>minimum 5 km.</li></ul><p>The result should look like in figure 8.42. </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig842.png" alt="Creating random points inside a polygon layer" title="Creating random points inside a polygon layer"/></p><p>Figure 8.42 - Creating random points inside a polygon layer</p><p>The resulting point layer will look approximately like in figure 8.43.</p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig843.png" alt="Point data layer - randomly created within specified polygons" title="Point data layer - randomly created within specified polygons"/></p><p>Figure 8.43 - Point data layer - randomly created within specified polygons.</p><p>Now that we have our imaginary meteo stations that measure precipitations in Pampanga province, we will continue by adding fictitious measurements on the course of 7 days. </p><p>To do that, we can use the random function provided by QGIS. Open the attribute table of the point data layer created and open field calculator. In a newly created field (Whole number integer), insert the following formula rand(min, max), where min and max will be replaced by the following pair of numbers for the corresponding 7 days (see figure 8.44):</p><ol><li>0 - 59;</li><li>2 - 35;</li><li>10 - 45;</li><li>0 - 21;</li><li>5 - 63;</li><li>0 - 10;</li><li>0 - 21. </li></ol><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig844.png" alt="Creating random values within specified limits" title="Creating random values within specified limits"/></p><p>Figure 8.44 - Creating random values within specified limits</p><p>After adding all 7 columns, your attribute table should look like in figure 8.45. </p><p><img src="/okf-open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/philippines/module8/media/fig845.png" alt="Fictitious precipitation data for the 93 fictitious meteo stations in Pampanga province" title="Fictitious precipitation data for the 93 fictitious meteo stations in Pampanga province"/></p><p>Figure 8.45 - Fictitious precipitation data for the 93 fictitious meteo stations in Pampanga province.</p><p>Next, we will interpolate these values for each of the 7 days  to obtain a seamless layer that covers the entire territory of the province.

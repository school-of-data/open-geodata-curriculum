tabindex="-1" href="#the-raster-data-model"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The raster data model</h3><p>A raster is a regular matrix of values, as in figure 9.1.</p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig91.png" alt="A matrix of values" title="A matrix of values"/></p><p>Figure 9.1 - A matrix of values</p><p>Values can be assigned either to<strong> grid points</strong>, mostly to the centroids, and in this case the raster can be referred to as a lattice. The second option is for the values to be assigned to the whole of the <strong>grid cell </strong>- called pixels (see figure 9.2). For the first case, the raster usually represents a continuous field, such as elevation, temperature, precipitations, chemical concentrations etc. For the second case, when the values are assigned to the entire area of the pixel, the raster usually represents an image - a satellite image, a scanned map, converted vector maps (see Phase 2). It must be noted that this data model is not particularly efficient for networks and other types of data heavily dependent on lines, such as property boundaries. </p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig92.png" alt="On the left side, the values are assigned to centroids.

On the right, values are assigned to the grid cell area - the pixel."/></p><p>Figure 9.2 - On the left side, the values are assigned to centroids. </p><p>On the right, values are assigned to the grid cell area - the pixel. 				</p><h3 id="rational-of-raster-processing"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#rational-of-raster-processing"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Rational of raster processing</h3><p>As in the case of vector data processing, the rationale behind the raster data processing is based on the very same capacity of the geographical information systems to store, process  and represent information of the real world phenomena, just that the way in which this is accomplished differs. Instead of having distinct points, lines and polygons stored as collections of x and y coordinates, we have a matrix of values that drapes over a specific area like a mesh. To have a clearer picture in mind, imagine the temperature maps shown on TV. Temperature is a continuous field, there are no places on the surface of the Earth without temperature, be it positive, negative or 0.</p><p>Many operations can be performed on raster datasets, the concept of geoprocessing detailed in module 8 applies here as well. The term used to encompass the operations that can be performed on rasters is <em>map algebra</em>. </p><p><strong>Map algebra</strong> represents a set of primitive operations<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> in a GIS which allows two or more raster layers of <em>similar dimensions</em> to produce a new raster layer (map) using various operations such as addition, subtraction, comparison etc.  </p><p>There are four categories of operations that can be performed on rasters, as follows: </p><ul><li>Arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.</li><li>Statistical operations: minimum, maximum, average, median.</li><li>Relational operations provide comparisons between cells using functions such as greater than, smaller than or equal to.</li><li>Trigonometric operations: sine, cosine, tangent, arcsine between two or more raster datasets.</li><li>Exponential and logarithmic operations use exponent and logarithm functions.</li></ul><p>For each of these operations, there are algorithms implemented in most GIS environments that allow a user to apply them on her data. In the following, we will also implement some of the most common operations to get a sense of how to work with and what should one expect from this kind of data processing. </p><p>The concept of <em>similar dimensions</em> refers to the characteristics of the raster datasets. That is, the operations detailed above can not be performed with meaningful results on 2 raster datasets with different spatial, temporal or spectral resolutions. In the following, we will very shortly introduce all four resolutions that are relevant for raster imagery.</p><p>Remembering what are the 4 types of resolutions of a satellite imagery (raster with values assigned to cell area - pixels): </p><ol><li><p><strong>Spatial resolution</strong> corresponds to the elementary size of the ground surface measured, it is expressed in units of length and it represents the length of a pixel side (see figure 9.3). For example, as you’ve seen in module 3, the High Resolution Settlement Layer Data has a spatial resolution of 30 meters, i.e. each pixel of the dataset estimates the number of people living within a 30-meter. </p></li><li><p><strong>Temporal resolution</strong> is associated with overhead imagery (images acquired by satellites, planes, helicopters, drones) and it corresponds to the period between 2 consecutive images of the exact same point on Earth, taken in the same conditions (as much as possible), such as the same aircraft, same altitude etc. For example, Landsat 8 has a temporal resolution of 16 days, i.e. each point on Earth is revisited by the Landsat 8 satellite each 16 days<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>. </p></li><li><p><strong>Spectral resolution</strong> - the sensors onboard of satellites or airplanes capture electromagnetic radiance coming from all objects on Earth - water, settlements, forests, roads, buildings, bare land etc. - and the sensors are specifically built to capture it at a given known spectral band (or wavelength). The human eye can see a very small part of the electromagnetic spectrum - the visible light (red, green and blue), but sensors can ‘see’ much more! (see figure 9.4)</p></li></ol><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig94.png" alt="Electromagnetic spectrum (photo credit [NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro))" title="Electromagnetic spectrum (photo credit [NASA Science](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro))"/></p><p>Figure 9.4 - Electromagnetic spectrum (photo credit NASA Science - <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro">https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro</a>)</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Radiometric resolution</strong> is determined by the number of bits into which the recorded radiation is divided. In 8-bit data, the digital numbers (DN) can range from 0 to 255 for each pixel (28 ¼ 256 total possible numbers). Clearly, more bits means that the sensor can detect more subtle changes in the energy it captures, that leads to a ‘clearer’ image, a  higher radiometric accuracy of the sensor but also requires more space to store the data. </li></ol><p><strong>Spectral bands</strong></p><p>A raster dataset contains one or more layers called bands. Each band stores another set of information on the area the raster covers. Each band has the exact same extent and coordinates, but not necessarily the same spatial resolution. Also, aside from the values stored, there are other key properties contained, such as: maximum, minimum and mean cell values and <em>histogram</em> of cell values. </p><p>A <strong>histogram</strong> is an approximate representation of the distribution of numerical data (see figure 9.5), in other ways is a manner in which one can get a sense of the data at hand.</p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig95.png" alt="Example of a histogram, where x is a raster layer" title="Example of a histogram, where x is a raster layer"/></p><p>Figure 9.5 - Example of a histogram, where x is a raster layer</p><p>Why is this important in our context? Because, as mentioned at the beginning, a raster is a matrix of continuous numerical values (remember the temperature example) and a histogram helps the user understand how the values of his rasters are distributed. Each bar groups the cell values that fall in a specific range, higher the bar more cells have values in that specific range. In case, the raster has more than one band, then the histogram will be computed for each one. There are no gaps between the ranges depicted on a histogram, the histogram is used only for continuous data.  </p><h2 id="main-content"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#main-content"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Main content</h2><h3 id="phase-1-understanding-your-raster-data"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#phase-1-understanding-your-raster-data"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Phase 1: Understanding your raster data.</h3><p>In the last two decades, the number of satellites capturing data from Earth has grown exponentially. Furthermore, an open data access policy that has been adopted by different space agencies, such as NASA for the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/nli/landsat/landsat-data-access?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con">Landsat program</a> or the European Space Agency for the <a href="https://www.copernicus.eu/en/access-data">Copernicus program</a>, has opened the door for an overwhelming stream of Earth Observation data. As a natural consequence, the scientific progress of algorithms, methodologies and the development of more powerful tools to process raster data - especially satellite imagery - has been impressive and extensive in fields such as agriculture, forestry, urban development, humanitarian activities, ocean and sea water monitoring, security and so many more. In the following 3 phases, we will introduce some of the most common processing techniques and what results to expect from them. </p><h4 id="step-1-prepare-your-working-environment"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#step-1-prepare-your-working-environment"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a><strong>Step 1.

A DSM includes ground surface, vegetation and man-made objects, such as buildings, bridges etc. as opposed to the digital terrain model (DTM) that considered strictly the terrain. </p></li><li><p>Dynamic Land Cover Map is a  Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) product derived from the PROBA-V 100 m time-series and several other land cover datasets.  The product provides primary land cover discrete classes, as well as continuous field layers for all basic land cover classes that provide proportional estimates for vegetation/ground cover for the land cover types. The product has 3 bands: discrete_classification, forest_type and urban_coverfraction. The following 2 tables present the values for each discrete class: </p></li></ol><p>Tabel 1 Discrete_classification band value table</p><table><tr><td><strong>Value</strong></td><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>282828</td><td>Unknown.

For the digital surface model, make one group named SRTM DEM. </p><p>Don’t forget to also add the boundary of the working area, Kiambu County, which is a vector dataset. </p><p>Your QGIS map window should look like in figure 9.6, maybe in slightly different colors. </p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig96.png" alt="Loaded raster datasets" title="Loaded raster datasets"/></p><p>Figure 9.6 - Loaded raster datasets</p><h4 id="step-2-understand-what-you-are-looking-at"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#step-2-understand-what-you-are-looking-at"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a><strong>Step 2. Understand what you are looking at.</strong></h4><p>Next, we will use a series of tools that will allow us to get a sense of the data we are working with. </p><p>After loading all the datasets, we will check the coordinate reference system in which all our datasets are in.  As we know from previous modules, QGIS offers the possibility to reproject all datasets loaded into the project on the fly, however that could lead to geoprocessing issues along the way. Thus, even if all layers are correctly overlaid, as can one say by visual inspection, we will proceed in reprojecting them all in the official coordinate system of our region of interest, Kiambu County - EPSG: 21037. </p><p>There are several ways to get information on the loaded layers in QGIS, some providing the user with more details than others. For a quick overview of a dataset’s metadata, <strong>double-click the layer and open Properties ‣ Information</strong>.</p><p>For layer HRSL_Kiambu_Population, the information window would look like in figure 9.7. </p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig97.png" alt="Extracting basic metadata from a raster layer" title="Extracting basic metadata from a raster layer"/></p><p>Figure 9.7 - Extracting basic metadata from a raster layer</p><p>With regard to our first question on what CRS is being used for the datasets we have loaded, we can observe that even if the HRSL is correctly overlaid, the dataset native’s projection is EPSG 4326 - WGS 84 - Geographic, with units measured in degrees. We also identify that this specific raster layer has only one band, yet the pixel size is difficult to read as the measurement is in degrees and not meters, which would make it easier to understand. </p><p>Thus, the first thing to do is to reproject all datasets we will work with in the same coordinate system - EPSG 21037.</p><p>Starting with the HRSL datasets, we go to <strong>Raster ‣ Projections ‣ Warp (Reproject)</strong> (see figure 9.8).</p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig98.png" alt="Reproject functionality in QGIS" title="Reproject functionality in QGIS"/></p><p>Figure 9.8 - Reproject functionality in QGIS</p><p>After selecting the Warp functionality, a new window will appear allowing the user to set the correct parameters (see figure 9.9a). </p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig99_a.png" alt="Warp (reproject) QGIS window" title="Warp (reproject) QGIS window"/></p><p>Figure 9.9a - Warp (reproject) QGIS window</p><p>If you selected the output to be <strong>[Save to temporary file]</strong> then there will be a raster layer named <code>Reprojected</code> in the Layers Panel. This is a memory layer and you can rename this layer to Reprojected_HRSL_Kiambu_Population and save it to make it persistent.</p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig99_b.png" alt="Reprojected HRSL" title="Reprojected HRSL"/></p><p>Figure 9.9b - Reprojected HRSL</p><p>You will notice that unlike when you reprojected vector datasets, there is a new parameter that you can set “Resampling method to use”. </p><p><strong>Resampling</strong> represents the interpolation of the cell values so that it transforms the raster as indicated by the user. There are multiple resampling methods available within the warp functionality, each with its own mathematical support. Yet, detailed explanations on each one is not the scope of this exercise. Further reading is available at references. </p><p>In this particular case, we want to reproject population data - numerical values and based on the selected resampling method (nearest neighbour),  the coordinate of each output pixel will be used to calculate a new value from close-by pixel values in the input layer (see figure 9.10). </p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig910.png" alt="Resample method - nearest neighbour" title="Resample method - nearest neighbour"/></p><p>Figure 9.10 - Resample method - nearest neighbour (photo credit: ILWIS documentation - <a href="http://spatial-analyst.net/ILWIS/htm/ilwisapp/resample_functionality.htm">(http://spatial-analyst.net/ILWIS/htm/ilwisapp/resample_functionality.htm</a>)</p><p>Input pixels are represented by dashed black lines, coordinates of input pixels by black dots; output pixels are represented by red solid lines, coordinates of output pixels by red plus signs. The grey arrows indicate how output values are determined. It can be seen in figure 9.10, some values of the input map may be used twice in the output map, while other input values may not be used at all. That is why, although one of the fastest methods to resample,  it is not appropriate in our case, as we are working with numerical data - population data. This resampling method is suitable for categorical data - such as land cover values. </p><p>To reproject our population raster dataset, we will use the bilinear interpolation method to resample the pixel values (see figure 9.11).</p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig911.png" alt="Resample method - bilinear" title="Resample method - bilinear"/></p><p>Figure 9.11 - Resample method - bilinear (photo credit: ILWIS documentation - <a href="http://spatial-analyst.net/ILWIS/htm/ilwisapp/resample_functionality.htm">(http://spatial-analyst.net/ILWIS/htm/ilwisapp/resample_functionality.htm</a>)</p><p>The bilinear method determines the new value of a cell based on a weighted distance average of the four nearest input cell centers. It is useful for continuous data and will cause some smoothing of the data. </p><p>We proceed in checking the CRS of the 5 land cover datasets that we have loaded into our QGIS project. Accessing <strong>Layer properties ‣ information</strong>, we can see that all 5 land cover layers are projected in EPSG:3857 - WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator. One solution would be to use the Reproject tool and configure for each layer individually. Yet, a faster way is to use the reproject functionality running as a <strong>batch process</strong>.</p><p><strong>Batch processing</strong> is the ability of running repetitive processes on data, with minimum user interaction. Most QGIS functionalities have this option available and it can be activated in the process window by clicking the <strong>Run Batch Process</strong> button <img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/batch-btn.png" alt="Run batch processe button" title="Run batch processe button"/> and switching to the Run batch process tab (see figure 9.12). </p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig912.png" alt="Batch processing tab on a QGIS functionality window" title="Batch processing tab on a QGIS functionality window"/></p><p>Figure 9.12 - Batch processing tab on a QGIS functionality window</p><p>For the 5 land cover raster layers, we will use the batch processing and as resample method nearest neighbour. To add a new layer, click on the + pictogram. To automatically fill the CRS and resampling method parameters, click on autofill button on top of the corresponding columns and select <code>Fill down</code>. Rename the reprojected rasters by adding the EPSG code at the end of the name, for example LandCover2015, will become landCover2015_21037. Set your parameters as in figure 9.13: source CRS: EPSG: 3857, target CRS EPSG 21037, resampling method to use: nearest neighbour (we explained in the paragraph above why), nodata value for output bands: 255 (from the information window, we see the data type - yte - 8bit unsigned integer - which means that the maximum value can be 255), output resolution:100 m (as the initial land cover rasters). After setting all parameters, check the box in the left corner of the window - <strong>Load layers on completion</strong> and click <strong>Run</strong>. </p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig913_a.png" alt="Batch processing to reproject the land cover rasters" title="Batch processing to reproject the land cover rasters"/></p><p>Figure 9.13a - Batch processing to reproject the land cover rasters</p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig913_b.png" alt="Autofill output names" title="Autofill output names"/></p><p>Figure 9.13b - Autofill output names</p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig913_c.png" alt="Reprojected land cover rasters" title="Reprojected land cover rasters"/></p><p>Figure 9.13c - Reprojected land cover rasters</p><p>Next comes the digital surface model rasters. As one can observe, to cover our region of interest, we needed several <em>raster tiles</em>. When raster files become too large - imagine one single DSM file at 30 m for Europe which has over 10 million square kilometers - they are splitted into <strong>tiles </strong>because, in smaller areas, they are more easily manageable. </p><p>Although we could use the wrap tool in batch mode to reproject all the DSM raster files, at a visual inspection, one can also notice that the delimitations between each tile is fairly visible, making it, at least, visually unattractive. What would be useful is to have a complete overview of the terrain, as a continuous phenomena - as it is, in fact - without artificial disruptions. To obtain that, we will use the GDAL merge tool, available in the Processing toolbar to merge all DSM rasters together. To open it, go to <strong>Processing ‣ Toolbox</strong> and in the search bar write <strong>Merge</strong> (see figure 9.14). Alternatively, you can search for Merge in the Locator Bar.</p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig914.png" alt="Finding the GDAL merge tool in the Processing Toolbox" title="Finding the GDAL merge tool in the Processing Toolbox"/></p><p>Figure 9.14 - Finding the GDAL merge tool in the Processing Toolbox </p><p>In the merge window that opens, select the DSM raster files that we want to mosaic and click run.

</code></pre><p>After preparing the rasters by reprojecting them into the CRS we are working with and reading their metadata to better understand the files, it is time to delve in the actual data. To achieve that, we will calculate and interpret the histograms (see Breakdown of concepts section for details) of our rasters. </p><p>To calculate a histogram, select the raster layer you are interested in, open by double clicking the <code>Properties</code> dialog window and go to <code>Histogram</code> (see figure 9.17). </p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig917.png" alt="Histogram window" title="Histogram window"/></p><p>Figure 9.17 - Histogram window</p><p>Hit the <code>Compute histogram</code> button and QIS quill automatically compute it. </p><p>After computing the histogram, we can see that the mouse turns into a loupe.

We are referring to the <strong>Value Tool</strong> that allows immediate identification of cell values by hovering over raster layers. </p><p>Go to <strong>Plugin ‣ Manage and Install Plugins</strong> and search for the <strong>Value Tool</strong> plugin and click install. Afterwards, right click on the QGIS main window bar to open all available Panels and Toolbars in your QGIS installation and select the <strong>Value Tool panel</strong>.

That is undesirable due to several reasons but mainly because you end up processing more data than you actually need, which translates in bigger storage and computer processing needs. That is why, before moving forward to any other steps, we will make sure that we process exactly as much data as we need. <strong>Be aware </strong>as you will start working on your own datasets, that the size of your files is an important factor when it comes to processing times. The bigger the files, more time will be required. Because of the model data structure - raster vs vector - raster files are usually much larger. </p><p>As you have noticed by now, the datasets we load into a GIS - in our case into QGIS - can be processed together even if they are of different nature, such as joining csv tables to vector layers to add information to geometries. The same applies to raster and vector data, as we will see. </p><p>To work only with raster layers that are relevant to
County, we will use the vector extent layer (kiambu_admin_boundary) to cut/clip all relevant raster layers. Go to <strong>Raster ‣ Extraction ‣ Clip Raster by Mask Layer</strong> (see figure 9.22).

You must know how many people live between 0 and 200 m altitude in the Kiambu County. There are a few elements to consider. Firstly, what is the data we will use and what are its characteristics. For population, we have the High Resolution Settlement Layer Data and for relief, we have the ALOS World 3D - 30m (AW3D30). Both raster layers have a spatial resolution of 30m, which allows us to proceed to other considerations. Relief is a continuous phenomena, the spread of the population is not, yet the report would make no sense to be done by the 30m pixel. We need to identify all the pixels with cell values from 0 to 200. Considering the histogram of the DSM_mosaic for our region of interest, we’ve seen that most cell values are between 0 and 200m. We can proceed to making a basic relief map based on the following divisions: </p><ol><li>0 - 50m</li><li>51 - 100m</li><li>101 - 150m</li><li>151 - 200m</li><li>250 - 600m</li><li>600 - 1300m</li></ol><p>Using your knowledge acquired in module 4, you can style the DSM layer by these categories.

To do that, we will use <strong>Raster Calculator</strong>. This is a functionality allowing the user to perform calculations on the basis of existing raster pixel values. The results are written to a new raster layer in a GDAL<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup>-supported format.</p><p>There are several ways to open the raster calclulator in QGIS.

We know that the value cells of the DSM-mosaic_clipped represent a continuous numerical data (not discrete values, such as LandCover). Therefore, the operation we need to employ in this case is a comparison one - cell values &lt;= 200 meters.

We have used the digital surface model and the High Resolution Settlement Layer to find out how many people live below 200m in Kiambu County. Before doing any analysis, we made sure that the datasets were in the same projection and, furthermore if the rasters have the same spatial resolution so that the results we obtained are viable. When referring to the coordinate reference system, the reasoning is clear, but why the same spatial resolution? </p><p>Remembering spatial resolution, it is the size of the ground surface measured in units of length, in other words, the size of the pixel measured on ground. If a raster has a 30m resolution, that means that the smallest linear object we could detect on that image is of 30 m, any smaller and we could not detect it. Continuing the analogy, we can compare it with the scale of a map. If a map has a scale of 1:25000, that means that 1 unit of length on the map represents 25000 units on the ground, that is 1 cm is 25000cm, 1 cm on the map equals 250m on the ground. For example, a 2km road would have 8 cm on the map.</p><p>Why is that important when working with raster datasets?

Remember as we detailed at the beginning that the value of the pixel cell is attributed to the entire area it covers, yet that does not mean that is the reality on the ground. These represent decisions made by the EO experts that derive various products based on Earth Observation imagery - all documented in peer-reviewed papers and algorithm descriptions. Further explanations are beyond the scope of this module, but it is important to keep in mind the relation between what a sensor onboard a satellite captures and the products we use. </p><p>Coming back to our region of interest - Kiambu County - we can test these differences with the data that we have at hand. We have loaded into our QGIS project the 5 raster layers of LandCover for 5 years: 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Next, we will load a mosaic of Sentinel-2<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6" class="footnote-ref">6</a></sup> imagery. We will load the WMS layer EOX Sentinel-2 cloudless, available <a href="https://s2maps.eu/">here</a>.

Remember that the LandCover product is at 100m and Sentinel 2 imagery is at 10m. To accomplish that, we will open the Clipped_Reprojected_LandCover 2019 and the WMS layer. To make comparisons between 2 layers, we will use a new plugin that you must install. Therefore, go to <strong>Plugins ‣ manage and install plugins</strong> and write in the search box <code>MapSwipe Tool</code>. Once you install it, it should appear as a new pictogram in your toolbar (<img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/mapswipe-btn.png" alt="MapSwipe Tool button" title="MapSwipe Tool button"/>). </p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig941.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 9.41 - Comparing 2 raster layers using MapSwipe Tool plugin </p><p>To activate the MapSwipe tool, click on it while the raster layer you want to drape is selected in the Layers Panel. The resolution differences are obvious, as well as the fact that the satellite product (Land Cover) has been developed using a satellite image (PROBA-V) of a coarser resolution. However, the general larger classes are well identified, as can be seen in figure 9.42. </p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig942.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 9.42 - LandCover2019 obtained from PROBA-V(100m) on top of Sentinel 2 mosaic (30m)</p><p>Adding the HRSL to the map, will show a good match between HRSL and the LandCover.

As a preprocessing phase, the user must <em>resample</em> one of the 2 to match. </p><p><strong>Resampling</strong> refers to changing the cell values due to changes in the raster cell grid and there are only 2 options: (1) <strong>upsampling</strong> refers to cases where we are converting to higher resolution/smaller cells and (2) <strong>downsampling</strong> is resampling to lower resolution/larger cell sizes. </p><p>Let us imagine the following exercise. We need to identify the population numbers for each category of land cover we have defined in the Kiambu County. As explained above, we need to <em>pre-process</em> the data we have in order to get viable results from our analysis, i.e. in our case, we need to bring both our raster datasets to the same spatial resolution. As detailed above, we can either increase or decrease the pixels’ dimensions. It must be highlighted that resample, with up or downscale, will involve an interpolation process (see page 12 for more details) - so the result introduces a statistical error. The usual practice is to resample all rasters to correspond to the raster with the lower resolution, but again this decision must be taken with consideration to all factors. Detailing the decision making process for resampling raster layers far exceeds the scope of this curriculum. </p><p>A difference between the 2 products must be highlighted: the LandCover product covers the <strong>entire area</strong> of the considered extent, as opposed to the HSRL product, where the raster layer contains strictly the cell where values above 0 exist. This situation poses issues when interpolation cell values to resample, because no matter the interpolation method chosen, that would take into consideration the surrounding pixels, following a specific well-defined algorithm and in this particular situation, the edge pixels are not at the edge of the study region, but within it. Therefore, in our demonstrative case, we will consider upsampling the Land Cover product from 100m to 30m resolution to match the LandCover product resolution. The resampling method we choose is crucial, as results can vary significantly. For the purpose of demonstration, we will resample the LandCover product using 2 different methods - Nearest Neighbour and Mode. </p><p>To resample, go to <strong>Raster ‣ Projections ‣ Wrap (reproject).</strong> In the functionality window set the following parameters: </p><ul><li>input layer: Clipped_Reprojected_LandCover 2019, </li><li>Source CRS and Target CRS: EPSG: 21037, </li><li>Resampling method: Nearest Neighbour, </li><li>No data: 255, output file resolution: 30, </li><li>Output data type: use input layer data type, </li><li>georeference extent: select the Clipped_Reprojected_LandCover 2019 layer. </li></ul><p>Save the output layer as LC2019_NearestNeighbour. </p><p><img src="/open-geodata-curriculum/images/en/kenya/module9/media/fig945.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"/></p><p>Figure 9.45 - Resampling the Land Cover layer</p><p>Follow the exact steps, except that for resample method parameter choose Mode.

Hence, the white spaces - pixels with no color assigned in figure 9.45.

We have taken a closer look at what resampling means and what are the implications of the rasters characteristics, such as coordinate reference system, spatial resolution etc. Most often, one must work with both raster and vector datasets and thus, it is important to know that it is possible in a number of ways. We’ve also tested a number of conversions, from raster to vector and vice-versa. However, in our processing we must not lose sight of the phenomena we are studying, as well as the initial scale at which the data has been collected, be it vector or raster. When performing conversions, it is important to know the correspondence between a map scale and raster resolution. According to cartographer Waldo Tobler “the rule is divide the denominator of the map scale by 1000 to get the detectable size in meters. The resolution is one half of this amount.” In other words, the formula would be:  <code>map scale = raster resolution (in m) X 2 X 1000. </code></p><p>The solutions given to our exercises in this module, as in module 8 as well, are just one way to solve the requirements. As one advances the study of the open source tools for geospatial, one finds out that there are several possibilities to get to the same outcome - some better than others. </p><h4 id="quiz-questions-2"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#quiz-questions-2"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Quiz questions</h4><ol><li>What is the name of the process through which the resolution of a raster datasets can be made higher or lower?</li></ol><ul><li><em><strong>Resampling.</strong></em> </li></ul><ol start="2"><li>What does a histogram show us? </li></ol><ul><li><strong>The frequency of pixel values, arranged in adjacent value ranges.</strong></li></ul><ol start="3"><li>Can a raster dataset be converted to a polygon?
